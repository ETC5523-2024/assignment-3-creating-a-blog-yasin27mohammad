Weighing between 300g and 752g, numbats have a body length of 175mm to 290mm and a tail measuring 120mm to 210mm. Unlike many mammals, numbats do not have proper teeth but instead have blunt “pegs” since they do not chew their food. Their forefeet, which bear five toes, and hind feet, with four toes, are equipped with strong, sharp claws used for digging termites from the soil.\n\nHistorically, numbats inhabited semi-arid and arid woodlands with Eucalyptus and Acacia trees, as well as grasslands. Today, they are restricted to eucalypt woodlands at elevations around 317 meters, where they find shelter in hollow logs. These logs not only offer refuge at night but also provide a place to hide from predators during the day, including birds and foxes. Numbats feed primarily on termites, consuming up to 20,000 termites daily, and have evolved specific physical traits to capture their prey efficiently.\n\nDespite conservation efforts, numbats have experienced dramatic declines, leading to their current endangered status. Although the available dataset includes records from as far back as 1856, this report will focus on the period from 2000 to 2023, analyzing population trends within this time frame.\n:::\n\n\n![](numbats.jpg)\n\n## **Data Description**\n\n\n-  The data used in this report was obtained from the TidyTuesday project, which is a weekly data sharing initiative that provides datasets for analysis and learning. The specific dataset used in this analysis was focused on the numbat population and was accessed via the TidyTuesday GitHub repository.\n\n   We named the data set as **numbats** has 805 observations and 16 variables. The numbats dataset contains observations of Numbat sightings and related environmental data. Key variables include the latitude and longitude coordinates of each sighting, as well as the date and time of the observation. The scientific name of the species observed is recorded, along with a taxon concept identifier for the species. Each sighting is uniquely identified by a record ID, and the data source responsible for the information is noted. The dataset also includes temporal information such as the year, month, day of the week, and hour of each observation. Furthermore, environmental data such as precipitation, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature on the sighting day are provided. Lastly, the dataset records whether the observation took place in Dryandra Woodland.Below @tbl-dictionary is the glimpse of our data set \n   \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {#tbl-dictionary .cell tbl-cap='Glimpse Numbats dataset'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<caption>Summary of Numbats Dataset with Specific Values</caption>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> variable </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> type </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> example_value </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> decimalLatitude </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> double </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> -37.65000 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> decimalLongitude </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> double </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 145.5333 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> eventDate </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> datetime </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2014-06-05 02:00:00 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> scientificName </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> character </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Myrmecobius fasciatus </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> taxonConceptID </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> character </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/6c72d199-fof1-44d3-8197-224a2f7cff5f </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> recordID </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> character </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 73830609-3d94-461f-a833-01c0a30c5a0d </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> dataResourceName </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> character </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Queen Victoria Museum Art Gallery provider for OZCAM </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> year </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> double </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2014 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> month </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> character </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Jun </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> wday </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> character </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Thu </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> hour </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> integer </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 13 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> day </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> date </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2014-06-05 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> dryandra </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> logical </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> FALSE </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> prcp </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> double </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 1.2 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> tmax </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> double </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 15.6 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> tmin </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> double </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 1.5 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-  The data was sourced from the Global Historical Climatology Network Daily (GHCND) using the ghcnd_stations() function. The dataset was filtered for Australian stations (ID starting with “ASN”). The dataset consists of 643 observations and 6 variables and was named aus_stations. and includes key variables such as the latitude and longitude coordinates, elevation, station name, station id and WMO ID. \n\n   The variables in the dataset include the station IDs, which identify each Australian station, and the latitude and longitude values that provide the geographic location of the station. The elevation variable records the height of the station above sea level in meters, while the station name provides a label for the station. Lastly, the WMO ID is the numeric identifier assigned to each station by the World Meteorological Organization.\n   \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\naus_stations <- ghcnd_stations() |>\n  filter(str_starts(id, \"ASN\")) |>\n  filter(last_year >= 2020) |>\n  mutate(wmo_id = as.numeric(wmo_id),\n         name = str_to_lower(name)) |>\n  select(-state, -gsn_flag) |>\n  filter(element %in% c(\"PRCP\", \"TMAX\", \"TMIN\")) |>\n  nest(element: last_year) |>\n  rowwise() |>\n  filter(nrow(data) == 3) |>\n  select(-data)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-  The first step of the data cleaning process involved filtering out rows with missing values in the year column and retaining only records from the year 2000 onwards. This was accomplished using the filter() function with the conditions !is.na(year) to remove rows where the year is missing, and year >= 2000 to include only observations from the year 2000 and later. This ensures that the dataset is clean and focused on the relevant timeframe for analysis..\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnumbats_new <- numbats |> \n  filter(!is.na(year),# remove the missing value\n         year>=2000)  \n```\n:::\n",
